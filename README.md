# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📌 Project Overview
This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to identify different customer groups to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer experience.
📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

Customer ID → Unique identifier for each customer
Gender → Male/Female
Age → Customer's age
Annual Income (k$) → Income in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100) → Score assigned based on spending behavior
These features help in clustering customers into distinct groups based on their shopping behavior.

⚡ Implementation Steps
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✅ Load the dataset
✅ Check for missing values
✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2️⃣ Data Visualization
✅ Histograms & scatter plots
✅ Pairplots using Seaborn

3️⃣ Apply K-Means Clustering
✅ Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
✅ Fit the K-Means model
✅ Assign cluster labels to customers

4️⃣ Visualizing Clusters
✅ Scatter plot of customer segments

📌 Results & Insights
🔹 Identified different customer groups based on income and spending behavior.
🔹 Used K-Means Clustering to classify customers into meaningful segments.
🔹 Visualized clusters using scatter plots for better understanding.
